# Digis Test

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.2.

# Notes and considerations to the Test Task
1. I don't know the relation between enterPrice and exitPrice, so I assumed that exitPrice cannot be higher than enter price
2. I assume that user can type enter date as today. As we speak about dates, hours are not considered
3. Shares list is implemented as Id/name pair
4. Whole component is implemented as a dialog. It is for sure could be done in other way, but I decided dialog fits the best
5. List of stocks wasn't mentioned in the task, but it's just a convenient way to show them
6. Highcharts was chosen as the most obvious way to show the chart with the balance. No customizations were mentioned in the task, so show it "as is"
7. Unit tests are added like just an example. They for sure do not cover all the components and use-cases
